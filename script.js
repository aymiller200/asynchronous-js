!Asynchronous JS, AJAX, APIs

? Synchronous: 
    * Most code is synchronous
    * Synchronous code is executed line by line in the exact order of execution that wew defined in our code.
        ?Thread of execution: Part of execution context that actually executes the code in the computer's CPU
    * Each line of code wwaits for previous line to finish
    * Long running operations block code execution
? Asynchronous: 
    * Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes
    * Asynchronous code is non-blocking
    * Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work
    * Asynchonous programming is all about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time.
? Ajax:
    * Asynchronous JavaScript And XML: Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With Ajax calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically
?API: 
    * Application Programming Interface: Piece of Software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other
    * There are many types of APIs in web development, for example: DOM API, Geolocation API, Own class API, "Online" API
    * "Online" API: Application running on a server that receives requests for data, and sends data back as a response.
    * We can build our own web APIs (requires back-end development, like with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs
    * Most APIs today use the JSON (JS object converted to a string)format, rather than AJAX

? Cors: Cross origin rescource sharing cannot access 3rd party apis without this.

! How the web works: Requests and responses.

?Request-response model or Client-server architecture:


*                       request
? Client (browser) --------------------> Webserver
?                  <--------------------
*                       response

? https://restcountries.com/v2/ :
    * Https: Protocal
        * Every URL gets an http or https which is for the protocol that will be used on this connection.
    * restcountries.com: Domain name
        * This is not the real address of the server we are trying to access.
        * DNS: Domain Name Server.
              * A special kind of server 
              ? First, the browser makes a request to a DNS and this special server will then simply match the web address of the URL to the server's real IP address.
              * After the real IP address has been sent back to the browser we can finally call it:
                  ? https://104.27.142.889.443
                protocal   IP address     port number(443 HTTPS, 80 HTTP)
                *Port number is really just to identify a specific service that iss running on a server.
              * Once we have the real IP address a TCP socket connection is established between the browser and the server, so they are now connected. 
              * TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
              * IP: Internet protocal
                  ? Together, TCP and IP are communication protocols that efine how data travels across the web. They are the internets fundamental control system
                  ? A communication protocol is simply a system of rules that allows two or more parties to communicate
              ? Second: Now it's finally time to make our request. 
                * The request that we make is an HTTP request (HyperText Transer Protocol, another communication protocol that allows clients and web servers to communicate.)
              ? What a request looks like: 
                * Start Line: HTTP Method + request target + HTTP version
                * HTTP Request Headers: Some information that we sent about the request itself (tons of standard different headers)
                * Request body: Only wwhen sending data to server -> POST
              ? Third: We get a response: 
                * Start line: HTTP Version + status code + status message
                * Response Headers: Info about the response itself (many different possibilities)
                * Body: Present is most responses. Contains the JSON data coming back from the API 
              !For web pages (not APIs)
                ? INdex.html is the first to be loaded
                ? Scanned for assets: JS, CSS, images
                ? Process is repeated for each file.
              !HTTP Methods (most important): 
                ? GET: requesting data
                ? POST: sending data
                ? PUT and PATCH: modifying data
            ?Main difference between HTTP and HTTPS: 
                *HTTPS is encrypted using TLS or SSL
    * /v2 : Resource

//! Building a simple Promise
//? Promise constructor takes exactly one argument -> The promise executor function (a function that takes in a resolve and reject argument)
//? The executor function will contain the asynchronous behavior that we're trying to handle with the promise (should eventually produce a resolve value)
//? Whatever value we pass into the resolve function is going to be the result of the promise that will be available in the then handler
//? Reject function, we pass in the error message that we later want to be able to access in the catch handler
//? We mostly only ever consume promises.We usually only build promises to wrap old callback based functions into promises. This is a process we call promisifying

//? Create a fulfilled or rejected promise immediately
